To test this, we have given you the impression that the profiles you saw were generated by AI. However, the profiles you have seen were written by real hosts and have not been generated.<br><br>\nThe findings of this study will help to better understand the potential benefits and risks that algorithmic mediation brings to our societies. For example, will people lose trust in each other's words as their communication becomes more AI-improved? We will analyze the answers given to provide some first insight.
